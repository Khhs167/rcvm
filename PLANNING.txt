Plan:

What we need:
 - Memory operations
 - Branching operations
 - Register operations
 - Stack operations
 - Subroutines
 - External linkage

Each instruction is 16 bits pre-data, and then whatever for arguments

All values are big-endian when encoded

External linkage:
    LDL => Load a library from a string and puts the ID of said library into the current cores LP
    LDS => Load a symbol from the library at LP, and resolves it for the machine to use

File structure:
    Header => Stores metadata 'n shit
    ROM => Stores code and anything needed by the software
    Library header => The library section stores all symbols in the library.
    Symbol table => The symbols themselves
